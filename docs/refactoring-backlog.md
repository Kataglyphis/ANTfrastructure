# Refactoring backlog

A living list of refactoring / hardening / efficiency candidates observed while
operating the cross build. Each item: **what**, **why it matters**, and a rough
**effort·impact**. Not a commitment — a triage queue. Newest observations at the
bottom under "Harvested during runs".

Legend — effort: S(mall)/M(edium)/L(arge); impact: ★ (nice) … ★★★ (high).

## Build efficiency / speed

- **onnxruntime WebAssembly target is built in the media stage.** `build_wasm_output`
  + `wasm-opt` (single-tool, low-parallelism, ~minutes of wall-clock per arch) is
  compiled even though a native container runtime never loads a `.wasm`. Gate it
  off unless explicitly wanted. — S · ★★
- **`01-core/parallelism.sh` is bind-mounted into ~21 media RUN steps.** Any edit to
  it (even behaviour-preserving, e.g. the 2026-07-11 refactor) changes the mount
  content and cache-misses **every** framework build (opencv/onnx/litert/gstreamer/
  torch), turning a 1-stage change into a full media rebuild. Consider splitting the
  rarely-changing job-math from the frequently-read helpers, or passing job counts
  as build-args so the script isn't on every RUN's cache key. — M · ★★★
- **Android NDK/SDK re-downloaded per arch.** Each android arch pulls the full NDK
  (r29, ~1 GB+) with no shared download cache → 3× the same download. Share via a
  common cache mount or a pre-fetch stage. — M · ★★
- **`--parallel-archs` is unusable in practice.** The 3× wall-clock lever exists but
  the orchestrator doesn't inject `BUILD_MEM_DIVISOR` (added 2026-07-11), so N
  concurrent per-arch builds each size against full RAM → OOM. Wire the divisor
  (build-arg → ENV) so parallel-archs is safe. See docs/build-parallelism-memory-tuning.md. — M · ★★★

## Build robustness / correctness

- **`verify-runtime-paths.sh` is toothless.** `errors=0` never increments, so it
  always exits PASSED; its `${VAR:-default}` escaped templates also defeat envsubst
  (false `/opt/gcc-\/` warns). Either make it a real gate or drop it — a green check
  that can't fail is worse than none. — S · ★★
- **`csound-sys` uses failure-then-patch-then-retry.** The first compile is *expected*
  to fail (signed-char array initialisers) before `patch_csound_sys_char_signedness`
  rewrites it and retries. Noisy in logs and relies on catching a build failure;
  pre-apply the patch instead. — S · ★
- **`PYTORCH_EXTRA="none"` is a stringly-typed sentinel.** Passing it straight into
  `--extra "${PYTORCH_EXTRA}"` caused the 2026-07-11 amd64 torch-missing outage
  (`--extra none` → uv sync fails → whole tree incl torch dropped). Fixed for that
  one call site, but the "none means no extra" convention is fragile — prefer empty
  string / an explicit boolean, and audit other `${PYTORCH_EXTRA}` / sentinel uses. — S · ★★
- **The riscv64 native-GCC smoke can't actually validate A2.** In the android stage
  the riscv64 gcc runs on the x86_64 host → `Exec format error` → classified as a
  benign "cross-build host limitation", so the `--march`/ISA-spec path is never
  exercised. Run the smoke under riscv64 binfmt/QEMU (or in the compiler stage) to
  get a real pass/fail. — M · ★★
- **ffmpeg runtime-lib list is doubly-maintained.** `setup-torch-venv.sh` now installs
  the auto-derived `/opt/ffmpeg/runtime-apt-packages.txt` manifest, but the hardcoded
  codec baseline (lines ~158-170) remains and can drift. Once the manifest is proven
  across a few runs, collapse to manifest-only (keep a tiny always-present core). — S · ★

## Observability / tooling

- **`resource-monitor.sh` rewrites its CSV on start.** A mid-run restart wipes
  history; safe for from-scratch runs but a foot-gun. Consider timestamped run-ids
  or append-with-resume. — S · ★
- **Managing background helpers via `pgrep`/`pkill` self-matches** the managing
  command (kills own shell, exit 144). A small `scripts/procctl` that filters by
  recorded PID files would remove the foot-gun. — S · ★
- **Log dir accumulates stale per-run logs.** Old `android-*.log` / `media-*.log`
  caused a false-positive smoke-watcher match (stale riscv64 log). The orchestrator
  could namespace logs under `<run-id>/` or truncate per-run. — S · ★★

## Harvested during runs

_(build-log signals collected while 0711f runs — triage into the sections above)_

### 0711f (full no-cache, launched 2026-07-11 17:58)

- **Stale-log false positives, confirmed twice.** The A2 smoke-watcher matched a
  prior run's `android-riscv64.log` (mtime hours before this run's `base` even
  started), reporting "A2 fired" when the fresh run was still in the compiler
  stage. This is the same log-namespacing gap already listed under Observability —
  now upgraded to ★★★: it produces *false green*, not just clutter. The orchestrator
  should write logs under `<run-id>/` (or truncate/rotate on start) so watchers and
  humans can't confuse runs. Interim mitigation: stale logs moved to
  `kata-rebuild-logs/stale-0711e/`. — S · ★★★
- **`base` stage: ~24 `update-alternatives: warning: skip creation of …man…` lines**
  (fakeroot/lzma/sudo/nano/vim man-page link groups). Pure noise — a real warning
  in this stage would be buried. Low value, but a `2>/dev/null` on the alternatives
  calls or a noise-filter in the log tee would help signal-to-noise. — S · ★
- **`compiler` stage: repeated `configure: WARNING: *** Makeinfo is missing`** across
  each GCC/binutils configure. Harmless (we don't ship GCC info docs) but printed
  N times. Install `texinfo` in the toolchain base *or* pass `MAKEINFO=true` to
  silence — trivially removes a recurring scary-looking warning. — S · ★
- _No real defects observed through base + early compiler. A2 (riscv64 GCC
  `--with-isa-spec`) not yet reached — compiler is still on the native x86_64 GCC._
